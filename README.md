![projectlightfall3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d31524-4b98-4127-96d8-da81a4f1ee28)

Project Lightfall is all about going up floor by floor to escape a facility filled with dangerous entities that have escaped. 
Heavily inspired by games like SCP foundation, Lobotomy Corporation and Lethal Company.
Currently the game only has only one floor to demonstrate more of the monsters and mechanics of the prototype.
